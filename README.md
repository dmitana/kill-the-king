## About the game
Kill the King is a 2D rogue-like, strategy game with RPG elements, where the player controls a group of
villains with various skills, that they can use in short turn-based battles lasting several minutes.
After battles with enemies and participation in events, the player will gain experience points. By
moving to another environment, the player can select new skills for his characters. The aim of the
game is to fight your way through the countryside, town and castle environments to the royal hall,
where the game ends after killing the King. The game also ends if all player's characters die, while
the death of the characters is permanent.
